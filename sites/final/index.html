                <h4 class=" mb-3 stamp">The Perfect Parasite</h4>
                <p>The best thing about Venom as a character is that he is always changing and evolving. He is a very mysterious, liquid-like symbiote that can 
                  inherit the bodies and strengths of his host, while also providing them with superhuman abilities. His primary ability is shapeshifting, allowing him to 
                  be anything and anyone he wants to be. As a child, I was drawn to him because of his edgy, dark dimeanor and his reputation as an anti-hero. He seems very 
                  misunderstood and the constant internal battles he fights with his hosts (both good and bad) leads fans to always question his intentions.

                <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3 stamp">Origin Story</h4>
                <p>Venom is an amorpheous symbiote hatched from an egg in a cavern on Klyntar, a planet ruled by the Knull alien race. With plans of using him as a tool of destruction, Venom 
                  refused to obey orders and was cast out of the planet to wander aimlessly through the cosmos. He was discoved during a war by the Kree, enemies of the Knull. He was bonded to Tel-Kar, 
                  his first host (chronilogically), and together they became a super soldier sent to fight in their war as a spy and assassin. During this war Venom was used to carry out genocide on his home planet, twisting him into 
                  a hate-filled predator. 
                  He later arrived on earth via a meteor that crash landed near New York. Captured and imprisoned, he fused with the suit of Peter Parker (spiderman) upon being mistakenly released from his cell. From then on, he was imprinted with 
                  Spiderman's abilities and carries these powers with him after he was forcibly removed from Parker. He moves from host to host, interfacing with their minds and feeding off of their adrenaline.
